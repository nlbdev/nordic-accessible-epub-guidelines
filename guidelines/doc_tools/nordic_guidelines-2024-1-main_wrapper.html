    <section id="abstract">
      This is a production guidelines document developed jointly by (mostly) Nordic agencies working with accessible literature production. It provides an application profile for accessible EPUB production, tailored to fit the needs of the Nordic agencies. It does not offer general advice for born-accessible e-book production, but rather supports the agencies' work in retrofitting already published works in different accessible formats.
